1. Variables:

    - Variables are storage locations in memory, where you can store a value and use it as a part of any expression.
    - Variable configuration comprises 3 basic elements

            a) Declaration  // var x;
            b) Assignment   // x = 40;
            c) Initialization   //  var x = 40; 

    - Declaration comprises of Variables name and behaviour.
    - Behaviour can be defined using the keywords "var, let and const".

        Syntax:
            var price;
            let stock;
            const rating;
    
    - Declaring variable is mandatory only when JavaScript is i strict mode.
    - Declaring variable is optional when JavaScript is not in strict mode.
    - After Declaring passing value into variable memory is called "Assignment".
    - Passing Value into variable while declaring is known as "Initialization".

         Syntax:
                var x;  //Declaring
                x = 50; // Assignment
                var x = 50; //Initialization
    
    Var:
        - It is used to configure a function scope for variable.
        - Functio scope allows to declare in any block and access from any another block inside function.
        - It allows declaring, Assignment and Initialization.
        - It allows shadowing.
        - Shadowing is the process of re-declaring or re-initializing same name identifier with in the scope.

                {
                    var x = 10; //Initialization
                     x = 20;    // Assignment
                     var x = 30;    // Shadowing
                }
            
        - It allows hoisting.
        - Hoisting is the process of declaring a variable in function scope without any order dependency.
        - Hoisting allows to use and declare later.

        EX:
        <Script>
        "use strict";
        function f1(){
            x = 10;
            document.write("X = "+ x);
            var x;
        }
        f1();
        </Script>

    
    Let:
        - It defines a block scope for variable.
        - Block scope allows to access with in the defined block and its inner blocks.
        - It allows declaring, assignment and Initialization.
        - It will not allow shadowing and hoisting.
