2. Simple Decision

- It is a Decision making approach that provides one alternative when condition evaluates to false.
- It is define by using "else" clause.

    Syntax:
            if(condition){
                statement on true;
            }
            else
            {
                statement on false;
            }

3. Multi Level Decision Making:

- It is a decision making approach where every condition is individually handled.
- It allows to track the exact issue in functionality and report the issue.
- It also implements a "Forward Jump" approach where it moves to next condition only when the previous evaluates to true.

    Syntax:
            if(condition-1){
                if(condition-2){
                    statement if all conditions evaluate to true;
                }
                else{
                    statements if condition-2 false;
                }
            }
            else{
                statement on condition-1 false;
            }

4. Multiple Choices:
    
- It is a programming approach of providing multiple alternatives for same task.
- Every alternative have its own statements to handle.
- 

    Syntax:
            if(condition-1){
                statement on condition-1 true;
            }
            else if(condition-2){
                statement on condition-2 true;
            }
            else{
                statement on both conditions false;
            }

Note: Configuring multiple Choices is a load for compiler if there are many conditions to check.
        Compiler checks all the conditions until the given is satisfied. It will delay the process and increases the compile time.

To Debug:

1. Right Click in browser.
2. Select Inspect.
3. Go to "Sources" category.
4. Select HTML page from sources.
5. Click at specific line number to set a "break-point".
6. Reload the page to start compiling in debug mode.
7. use "F10" function key [fn + f10] to move to next step.
