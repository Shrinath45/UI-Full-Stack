Primitive Types:
    - Number
    - String
    - Boolean                            
               
                            
                            Undefined

- It is type configured for variables if value is not defined at compile time.
- JavaScript uses "undefined" as keyword.

Syntax:
        var price;
        console.log(price);     // undefined

- You can verify by using "undefined" keyword or a simple condition that returns true when value is defined.

Syntax:
        var price;
        if(price){ }    // good
        if(price===undefined){ }        // valid but not good


FAQ: What is difference between not-defined and undefined?
Ans: not-defined specifies that the reference you are using not found.
    undefined specifies that the reference is present but there is no value defined.


                NULL

- It specifies that value is not defined into a reference at runtime of application.
- User can input values at runtime using querystring, prompt, form elements etc.
- If reference is not supplied with value then it returns "null" as type.
- You can use "null" keyword to verify the null type.

Syntax:
        var x= prompt("Enter value");
        console.log(x);         // returns null when prompt is cancelled
    
EX:
        var x= prompt("Enter Number");
        if(x==null){
            document.write(`You cancelled`);
        }else{
            document.write(`x = ${x}<br>`);
        }

                        Non-Primitive Types
                    

- Non Primitive are mutable types.
- They don't have a fixed structure.
- It changes according to memory available.
- They are stored in memory heap.
- Heap allows to access in any order. 
- JavaScript Non Primitive types are
    a) Array
    b) Object
    c) Map



                            Array
                    
- Arrays in programming are used to reduce overhead and complexity.
- Arrays reduce overhead by storing multiple values in sequential oreder.
- Arrays reduce complexity by storing multiple values under one reference name.
- Array is a collection of values in sequential order.
- You can store any type of value insequence, but few technologies can't allocate different memory types. Hence they restrict array to same type.
- Array is a type of arrangement for values in memory. where they have a sequence but accessed in random.
- JavaScript array can handle various type of data and can change the size dynamically.

Declaring Array:
- You can declare by using var, let or const.
- But array declaration requires memory assignment for initialization.
- You can initialize or assign memory for array by using 2 techniques.

    a) Array()  constructor
    b)[]    meta character

    Syntax:
            var values;
            values = [];        meta character [assignment]

            var values = [];        //initializing

            (or)

            var values = new Array();

            var values;
            values = new Array();
