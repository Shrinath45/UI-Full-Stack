                Object Type

- Object is used to keep all related data and logic together.
- So that it is easy to reuse the data and logic.
- "Alan Kay" introduced the concept of Object in early 1960's.
- Object is a collection of keys and values.

Syntax:
        var obj = {
            "key" : value;
            "key" : value;
        }

    - Key is string type and value can be any type.
    - The values are accessed and assigned with reference of key.

    Syntax:
            obj.key = newValue;
            console.log(obj.key);

    - If object comprises of only data then it is reffered as "JSON" [JavaScript Object Notation].
    
    EX:


- Object can contain actions that are defined by using function.
- JSON can't have actions it can have only data.
- Actions are defined using key that have the reference of anonymous function.

    {
        "key": function(){}
    }

- The function of object can return a value or can be void type.
- You can access keys in an object by using "this" keyword, which referes to current context.
- A function is executed with reference of key.

    Syntax:
            obj.key();
        
    EX:




                                Object Manipulations

1. Hoe to access all keys from object?
Ans: by using "for..in" statement or "Object.keys()" method.

    Syntax:
            for(var key in object){

            }

            Object.keys(objectname)[].map()

    EX:



2.How to remove a key?

Ans: by using JS "delete" operator.

Syntax:
        delete object.key;


3. How to verify a key in object?
A. by using JS "in" operator.

Syntax:
        "key" in object;    // true/false


4. How to know the data type of value in a key?
A. byn using JS "typeof" operator

Syntax:
        typeof object[key];     // number, string, boolean

        <script>
            var product= {
                ID: 1,
                Name: "Samsung TV",
                price: 400000,
                Stock: true
            }

            Object.keys(product).map(function(key){
                document.write(`${key} : ${product[key]} [${typeof product[key]}] <br>`);
            })
        </script>

5. How to hide any key in object?
A. By using "symbol" type.
    Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript.
    It hides a property over iterations but allows to use individually.

    Syntax:
            var [id] = Symbol();
            {
                [id]: value;
            }

        <script>
            var Id = Symbol();

            var product= {
                [Id]: 1,
                Name: "Samsung TV",
                Price: 400000,
                Stock: true,
            }

            Object.keys(product).map(function(key){
                document.write(`${key}:${product[key]} <br>`);
            })

            document.write(`Product Id: ${product[Id]}`);
        </script>
