                                    Boolean Type

- Boolean are used in decision making.
- Javascript booleans are defined with "true or false".
- Javascript boolean expression can be handle by using "0" or "1" as values
        0 = false
        1 = true

    Syntax:
            var x = true;

            if(x==1){
                            // not good
            }
            if(x==true){
                            // good
            }
    EX:
    <script>
    var stock = true;
    if(stock == 1){
        document.write("Available");
    }
    else{
        document.write("Not Available");
    }
    </script>

- Boolean values control by using "decision making & logical operators".

Decision Making Operators:
         
         ==         equal
         ===        identical equal
         !=         not equal
         !==        not identical equal
         >          Greater Than
         <          Less Than
         >=         Greater Than or Equal to
         <=         Less Than or Equal to

FAQ:    What is difference between "==" & "==="?
Ans:    "==" can compare values of different data types.
        "===" can compare values of only same data type.

        Syntax:
                10=="10"        //true
                10==="10"       //false
                10===10         //true
                "10"==="10"     //true

Logical Operators:

            &&      AND
            ||      OR
            !       NOT

            Syntax:
                    (condition1) && (condition2)        // true if both conditions are true. otherwise false
                    (condition1) || (condition2)        // true if any one condition is true.
                    !true                               // false
                    !false                              //true

Ternary Operators:[? :]

    (condition) ? true:false

    Syntax:
            your_condition ? statement_on_true : statement_on_false

            if(condition){
                statement on true;
            }
            else{
                statement on false;
            }

- Decision making in programming requires boolean types and selection statements.
- Selection Statement Keywords are:

        "if, else, switch, case, default"

The "IF" Statement:

    - It is a decision making statement used to control the flow of execution in a program.
    - It have several forms

        a) Forward Jump
        b) Simple Decision
        c) Multi Level
        d) Multiple

    A) Forward Jump:
        - It is the decision making approach where the statements are executed only when condition evaluates to true.
        - It will not provide any alternative progress.

        Syntax:
                if(condition){
                    statement on true;
                }
